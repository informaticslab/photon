Influenza A (H3N2) viruses were the most frequently identified viruses. Almost all viruses characterized thus far this season have been similar to the components of the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccine formulations. All influenza viruses tested to date have been sensitive to the antiviral drugs oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir.","implications":"Vaccination is the primary method to prevent influenza illness and its complications. Health care providers should continue to recommend influenza vaccination to all unvaccinated persons aged ≥6 months now and throughout the influenza season. As an adjunct to vaccine, treatment with influenza antiviral medications is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk for influenza-related complications. Antivirals can lessen severity and duration of illness and can reduce severe outcomes of influenza.

During 2006–2014, national coverage with ≥1 dose of tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) and ≥1 dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) increased annually. Since 2007, among females, HPV vaccination coverage has lagged behind Tdap and MenACWY coverage, with gaps of 28 and 17 percentage points, respectively, in 2014. HPV vaccination coverage among males has increased annually since 2011, but remains lower than coverage among females.","added_by_report":"In 2015, vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years increased for each HPV vaccine dose among males, ≥1 HPV vaccine dose among females, and ≥1 MenACWY among all adolescents.

Although prescription fentanyl can be diverted for misuse, most fentanyl overdoses and deaths have been linked to illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF), including fentanyl analogs. Multiple states that experienced increases in law enforcement submissions to laboratories of drug products that tested positive for fentanyl during 2013–2014 also reported sharp increases in fentanyl deaths.","added_by_report":"Analyses of 2013–2015 data from Florida and Ohio indicated that sharp increases in fentanyl deaths were associated with significant increases in the supply of IMF in these states, with fentanyl analogs detected in the Florida illicit market. Novel circumstances surrounding fentanyl mortality included current diagnosed mental health disorder and release from an institutional facility (e.g., a jail, treatment facility, or hospital) within the preceding 30 days. The risk profiles of fentanyl overdose decedents were similar to those of persons dying from heroin overdose.","implications":"The rapid increases in fentanyl deaths in Florida and Ohio illustrate the need to intensify efforts to expand use of naloxone. Increased naloxone access, particularly among community members, is critical given fentanyl’s potency and the possibility of causing rapid death. The relationship between fentanyl deaths and increases in the supply of IMF suggests that law enforcement testing data on drug cases could serve as an early warning system to detect variations in overdose risk related to changes in the drug supply. Multidisciplinary strategies from public health agencies, harm reduction communities, emergency medical services, law enforcement, and treatment services for substance use disorders might have the greatest impact on public health, given the close relationship between fentanyl mortality and confiscation of IMF.","tags":[{"tag":"Fentanyl"},{"tag":"Overdose"},{"tag":"Deaths"},{"tag":"Florida"},{"tag":"Ohio"}],"url":"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6533a3.htm?s_cid=mm6533a3_w","content-ver":"1","schema-ver":"1","command":"add"},

Diagnostic testing for Zika virus infection can be accomplished using both molecular and serologic methods. However, results of Zika virus antibody testing can be difficult to interpret because of cross-reactivity with related flaviviruses, which can preclude identification of the specific infecting virus, especially when the person previously was infected with or vaccinated against a related flavivirus. ","added_by_report":"For persons with suspected Zika virus disease, a positive real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) result confirms Zika virus infection, but a negative result does not exclude infection. In these cases, antibody testing can identify additional recent Zika virus infections. If immunoglobulin (Ig) M test results are positive, equivocal, or inconclusive, performing a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is needed to confirm the diagnosis. However, recent evidence suggests that a 4-fold higher titer by PRNT might not discriminate between anti-Zika virus antibodies and cross-reacting antibodies in all persons who have been previously infected with or vaccinated against a related flavivirus. Thus, a more conservative approach to interpreting PRNT results is now recommended to reduce the possibility of missing the diagnosis of either Zika or dengue virus infection.","implications":"All patients with clinically suspected dengue should receive appropriate management to reduce the risk for hemorrhagic medical complications. Pregnant women with laboratory evidence of a recent Zika virus infection or flavivirus infection should be evaluated and managed for possible adverse pregnancy outcomes and reported to the appropriate Zika virus pregnancy registry.

To adequately prevent unintended pregnancies, there is an estimated need for IUDs for 68,000 women, contraceptive implants for 33,000 women, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate for 11,000 women, oral contraceptives for 14,000 women, vaginal rings for 9,000 women, and contraceptive patches for 3,000 women.","implications":"Removing barriers to contraception, such as cost, limited access, and lack of knowledge, could lead to increased use of highly effective contraceptive methods and reduced rates of unintended pregnancy, resulting in fewer adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes in the context of a Zika virus disease outbreak. This assessment of the resources and challenges in Puerto Rico related to contraceptive access might be a useful model for other areas with active transmission of Zika virus.","tags":[{"tag":"Contraception"},{"tag":"Zika"},{"tag":"Puerto Rico"}],"url":"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6512e1er.htm?s_cid=mm6512e1er_w","content-ver":"1","schema-ver":"1","command":"add"},

The three most common forms of plague are bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic, with the majority of cases presenting as bubonic. Although the rarest form of plague (approximately 2% of reported cases), primary pneumonic plague has a high (≥93%) mortality rate when left untreated.","added_by_report":"The outbreak in Colorado represents the largest outbreak of pneumonic plague in the United States since 1924. The source of the outbreak was a dog with pneumonic plague, an atypical occurrence because dogs infected with Yersinia pestis generally are either asymptomatic or exhibit mild self-limiting febrile illness and are not considered a direct source of human infection. Four persons developed plague after exposure to the ill dog; one of the patients also had close contact with the index patient after he developed plague pneumonia, supporting possible human-to-human transmission. Diagnosis in the index case was delayed because of misidentification of a bacterial isolate as Pseudomonas luteola by an automated blood culture system. The spectrum of disease in this outbreak was broader than usual for pneumonic plague, with two of the four patients not requiring hospitalization, possibly as a result of self-administration of antibiotics or medical prescription of azithromycin, an antibiotic not recommended for plague.","implications":"Plague should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dogs with respiratory illness in areas where plague is endemic.

During 2007–2014, panel physicians began using the new screening algorithm in 147 of 151 jurisdictions. The diagnostic yield increased twofold to threefold, with approximately 1,100 cases of TB diagnosed worldwide during 2012; approximately 60% of these cases were smear-negative, but culture-positive, representing a gain in diagnostic yield with the new algorithm. Preliminary evidence suggests the percentage of persons with abnormal chest radiographs overseas, but negative sputum smears, who are diagnosed with TB upon arriving in the United States has decreased from approximately 7% to 1%–2%.
